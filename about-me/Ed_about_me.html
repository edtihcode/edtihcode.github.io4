      <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Hello, I am Edmond Tan, ex-rocket scientist turned entrepreneur turned coder. I grew up halfway across the globe in Asia and have been in US for almost 10 years since I received a scholarship to study aerospace engineering in the US. During my stay in the US from working with NASA  to fortune 500 companies, I came to the realization that 90% of the workforce as research have <a href= "https://www2.deloitte.com/insights/us/en/topics/talent/worker-passion-employee-behavior.html"> shown</a>. are not passionate about their job when we spend 1/3 of our lives working. Research has shown that if you work in what you are passionate in, you are happier and live a more fulfilling life. Thus, reducing burnout and increases retention, engagement and performance. Therefore, I made my way to San Francisco on this full-time mission to find like-minded people to join me in this cause to help people live a happier and more fulfilling life by matching them to job they are passionate about.</p>

      <h2>Hobbies and interest</h2>
        <p>I am a person that loves to immerse myself in creative thinking process. So naturally, I find myself gravitating to anything creative from designing new conceptual ideas/projects as you can see <a href= "https://drive.google.com/open?id=1i_m-JXPS9nAJ8DRkTARQtidL_JT4_nqs"> here</a> or just <a href= "https://drive.google.com/open?id=1_eMoCCcO0cLhSv7VF7FJy6B98ANC91a_"> artwork</a> in general. I used to be a hardcore gamer back in the days when I had more free time. It is a great way to destress as the virtual world had no creative limits. Aside from that, I enjoy sharing stories and experience like biking, hiking and exploring new places, cultures and food with good company of friends.</p>
      <br>

      <h2>Why I choose to take this class</h2>
        <p>Doing a tech startup is not easy. Especially, if you don't have core coding skills and have to rely on others to bring out your vision. Therefore, taking this class will help me get the skills I needed towards being a full-stack developer or a data scientist while potentially also meeting people with the skills that wants to join in the startup mission. Other than that, staying in San Francisco is not cheap, doing a startup full-time without an income is very painful unless you have a lot of money saved up. Taking this class would potentially help find a high paying job in the tech sector to help with survival while extending my runway.
